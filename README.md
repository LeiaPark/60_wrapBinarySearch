What is meant by y = log2x?
  
> The equation seeks to determine how many times 2 must multiply by itself to equal the value "x". The number of times is represented by the value "y".

What does its graph look like?

> The graph can be seen in the [fourth edition of Cohen's Precalculus with Unit Circle Trigonometry](http://davidmholmes.net/Stuy/ap/hw/logarithms.pdf)

### Recursive Solution Description

0. Decision-making: The low limit is less than or equal to the high limit.
1. Solution to base case: Return -1, which means the element wasnâ€™t found
2. Solution to recursive case:
> If the value at the middle index is equal to the value we are looking for

>     Return that middle index

> If the value we are looking for is less than the value at the middle index

>     Set the new high value to the middle index - 1
>     Call this function again with the new high value and same low value

> Else

>     Set the new low value to the middle index + 1
>     Call this function again with the new low value and same high value
